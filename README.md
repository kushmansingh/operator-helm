# Speedscale Operator

The [Speedscale](https://www.speedscale.com) Operator is a [Kubernetes operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)
that watches for deployments to be applied to the cluster and takes action based on annotations. The operator
can inject a proxy to capture traffic into or out of applications, or setup an isolation test environment around
a deployment for testing. The operator itself is a deployment that will be always present on the cluster once
the helm chart is installed.

## Install

A valid Speedscale API key is required to successfully install the chart.

1. Git clone this project
1. `cd operator-helm/<VERSION>`
1. Add Speedscale API key to values.yaml
1. `helm install speedscale .`
