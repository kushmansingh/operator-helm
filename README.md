# Speedscale Operator Helm Chart

The [Speedscale](https://www.speedscale.com) Operator is a [Kubernetes operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)
that watches for deployments to be applied to the cluster and takes action based on annotations.

This repository stores a Helm chart to apply the operator, though the recommended installation method is to generate Kubernetes manifests
from the [Speedscale CLI tool](https://github.com/speedscale/speedscale-cli).
